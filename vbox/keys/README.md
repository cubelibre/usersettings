MYBOX INsecure Keypairs
!!! It's the insecure public/private key for the mybox user, which will installed into the MYBOX boxes by default
 so that we can SSH to the boxes automatically. 
You may want to create your own keypair use `gen_mybox_keys.sh`, and customzied your MYBOX boxes to use them if security is concerned.
